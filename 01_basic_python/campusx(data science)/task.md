    - if experience is more than 3 years, average feedback should be 4.5 or more
    - if experience is 3 years or less, average feedback should be 4 or more
- he/she should posses the technology skill for the course

Identify the class name and attributes to represent instructors. Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

**Note:**
- Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public.
- An instructor may have multiple technology skills, so consider instance variable, technology_skill to be a list.
