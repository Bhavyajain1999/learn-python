Certainly! NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is widely used in scientific and engineering applications where numerical computations are involved. Here's an overview of NumPy with examples:

### Arrays in NumPy:

NumPy's main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy, dimensions are called axes.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1-dimensional array
arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("1D Array:", arr1d)

# Create a 2-dimensional array
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("2D Array:")
print(arr2d)

# Accessing elements of an array
print("Element at (0, 1):", arr2d[0, 1])  # Prints 2
```

### Array Operations:

NumPy arrays support various operations such as arithmetic operations, aggregation functions, and broadcasting.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
arr2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Element-wise addition
result_addition = arr1 + arr2
print("Element-wise Addition:")
print(result_addition)

# Element-wise multiplication
result_multiplication = arr1 * arr2
print("Element-wise Multiplication:")
print(result_multiplication)

# Matrix multiplication
result_matmul = np.matmul(arr1, arr2)
print("Matrix Multiplication:")
print(result_matmul)

# Aggregation functions
print("Sum of all elements:", np.sum(arr1))
print("Mean of all elements:", np.mean(arr1))
```

### Array Manipulation:

NumPy provides functions to reshape, concatenate, split, and transpose arrays.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Reshape array
reshaped_arr = np.reshape(arr, (3, 2))
print("Reshaped Array:")
print(reshaped_arr)

# Concatenate arrays
concatenated_arr = np.concatenate((arr, arr), axis=1)
print("Concatenated Array:")
print(concatenated_arr)

# Split array
split_arr = np.split(arr, 2)
print("Split Array:")
print(split_arr)

# Transpose array
transposed_arr = np.transpose(arr)
print("Transposed Array:")
print(transposed_arr)
```

### Random Number Generation:

NumPy provides various functions to generate random numbers.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate random numbers
random_array = np.random.rand(3, 3)  # Generate a 3x3 array with random numbers between 0 and 1
print("Random Array:")
print(random_array)
```

These are just some basic examples to illustrate the usage of NumPy. NumPy offers a wide range of functionality for numerical computing in Python, making it a fundamental library in the scientific Python ecosystem.


Sure! Let's dive deeper into NumPy arrays, their data types, and scalar/vector operations.

### Data Types in NumPy Arrays:

NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements in an array must be of the same data type. NumPy provides a variety of data types to choose from, such as integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), complex numbers (`complex`), and more. You can specify the data type while creating an array or let NumPy infer the data type.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Specifying data type while creating an array
arr_int = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int32)
print("Integer Array:", arr_int)
print("Data Type:", arr_int.dtype)

# Letting NumPy infer data type
arr_float = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
print("\nFloat Array:", arr_float)
print("Data Type:", arr_float.dtype)
```

### Scalar and Vector Operations:

NumPy arrays support scalar operations (operations between a single scalar value and an array) as well as vector operations (operations between two arrays of the same shape).

#### Scalar Operations:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Scalar addition
result_scalar_addition = arr + 1
print("Scalar Addition:", result_scalar_addition)

# Scalar multiplication
result_scalar_multiplication = arr * 2
print("Scalar Multiplication:", result_scalar_multiplication)
```

#### Vector Operations:

```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
result_vector_addition = arr1 + arr2
print("Vector Addition:", result_vector_addition)

# Element-wise multiplication
result_vector_multiplication = arr1 * arr2
print("Vector Multiplication:", result_vector_multiplication)
```

### Broadcasting:

NumPy also supports broadcasting, which allows for arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes.

```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
scalar = 2

# Broadcasting scalar with array
result_broadcasting = arr1 * scalar
print("Broadcasting Result:")
print(result_broadcasting)
```

In this example, scalar value 2 is broadcasted to match the shape of the array `arr1`, and then element-wise multiplication is performed.

NumPy provides a powerful set of tools for numerical computing in Python, offering efficient operations on arrays of data. Understanding data types, scalar/vector operations, and broadcasting is essential for working effectively with NumPy arrays.

Certainly! Let's explore how to use NumPy's `arange`, `reshape`, and `dtype` functions.

### `np.arange()`:

NumPy's `arange` function generates evenly spaced values within a given range. It is similar to Python's built-in `range` function but returns a NumPy array.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array of integers from 0 to 9
arr = np.arange(10)
print("Original Array:", arr)
```

### `reshape()`:

The `reshape` function in NumPy is used to change the shape of an array without changing its data. It can be used to convert a 1-dimensional array into a multi-dimensional array (and vice versa), provided that the total number of elements remains the same.

#### Example:

```python
# Reshape the array into a 2x5 matrix
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(2, 5)
print("Reshaped Array:")
print(reshaped_arr)
```

### `dtype`:

The `dtype` attribute of a NumPy array represents the data type of the elements in the array.

#### Example:

```python
# Check the data type of the array
print("Data Type of the array:", arr.dtype)

# Specify the data type explicitly
arr_float = np.arange(10, dtype=np.float64)
print("Array with specified data type:", arr_float)
print("Data Type of the array:", arr_float.dtype)
```

In this example, `np.float64` specifies that each element of the array will be of type 64-bit floating-point number.

### Putting it Together:

Here's how you can use `arange`, `reshape`, and `dtype` together:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array of 20 elements starting from 0, reshape it into a 4x5 matrix, and specify the data type
arr = np.arange(20).reshape(4, 5).astype(np.float32)
print("Final Array:")
print(arr)
print("Shape:", arr.shape)
print("Data Type:", arr.dtype)
```

This code creates a 1-dimensional array of 20 elements, reshapes it into a 4x5 matrix, and specifies the data type as 32-bit floating-point numbers.

Certainly! In addition to array creation, reshaping, and specifying data types, NumPy also supports relational operations between arrays, which allows for comparisons and logical operations.

### Relational Operations:

NumPy provides various functions for performing relational operations such as equality (`==`), inequality (`!=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), and less than or equal to (`<=`). These operations return boolean arrays indicating the result of the comparison element-wise.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

# Equality
print("Equality:", arr1 == arr2)

# Inequality
print("Inequality:", arr1 != arr2)

# Greater than
print("Greater than:", arr1 > arr2)

# Less than
print("Less than:", arr1 < arr2)

# Greater than or equal to
print("Greater than or equal to:", arr1 >= arr2)

# Less than or equal to
print("Less than or equal to:", arr1 <= arr2)
```

### Logical Operations:

NumPy also supports logical operations such as logical AND (`&`), logical OR (`|`), and logical NOT (`~`).

#### Example:

```python
# Create two boolean arrays
bool_arr1 = np.array([True, False, True])
bool_arr2 = np.array([False, True, True])

# Logical AND
print("Logical AND:", bool_arr1 & bool_arr2)

# Logical OR
print("Logical OR:", bool_arr1 | bool_arr2)

# Logical NOT
print("Logical NOT (for bool_arr1):", ~bool_arr1)
```

These operations return boolean arrays indicating the result of the logical operations performed element-wise. Relational and logical operations in NumPy are particularly useful for filtering and conditional operations on arrays.

You can create a 3x3 matrix in a NumPy array in several ways:

1. **Directly Enter Values:**
   You can directly enter the values of the matrix into a NumPy array.

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a 3x3 matrix
   matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                      [4, 5, 6],
                      [7, 8, 9]])

   print(matrix)
   ```

2. **Using `np.array` with a List of Lists:**
   You can create a NumPy array from a list of lists representing the rows of the matrix.

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a list of lists representing the rows of the matrix
   rows = [[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]]

   # Create a NumPy array from the list of lists
   matrix = np.array(rows)

   print(matrix)
   ```

3. **Using `np.zeros` or `np.ones`:**
   You can create a 3x3 matrix filled with zeros or ones and then modify the values as needed.

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a 3x3 matrix filled with zeros
   zeros_matrix = np.zeros((3, 3))

   # Modify values as needed
   zeros_matrix[0, 0] = 1
   zeros_matrix[1, 1] = 2
   zeros_matrix[2, 2] = 3

   print(zeros_matrix)
   ```

   Similarly, you can use `np.ones` to create a matrix filled with ones.

4. **Using `np.random.rand`:**
   You can create a 3x3 matrix filled with random numbers between 0 and 1.

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a 3x3 matrix filled with random numbers between 0 and 1
   random_matrix = np.random.rand(3, 3)

   print(random_matrix)
   ```

Choose the method that best suits your needs. The first method allows you to directly enter the values of the matrix, while the other methods provide different ways to create matrices depending on your requirements.

Certainly! NumPy is extensively used in data science for various tasks such as data manipulation, mathematical operations, and statistical analysis. Here are some common examples of NumPy usage in data science:

### 1. Creating Arrays:

NumPy arrays are the foundation of numerical computing in Python. Data scientists often use NumPy arrays to represent datasets and perform computations on them.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array from a list
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Create a 2D array (matrix) from a list of lists
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])
```

### 2. Statistical Operations:

NumPy provides functions to perform statistical operations on arrays, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.

```python
# Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and variance
mean_value = np.mean(arr)
median_value = np.median(arr)
std_dev = np.std(arr)
variance = np.var(arr)
```

### 3. Reshaping Arrays:

Data scientists often need to reshape arrays to match the required input format for algorithms or visualization libraries.

```python
# Reshape an array
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(5, 1)
```

### 4. Indexing and Slicing:

NumPy arrays support powerful indexing and slicing operations, allowing data scientists to access specific elements or subsets of the data efficiently.

```python
# Accessing specific elements
element = arr[0]

# Slicing arrays
subset = arr[1:4]
```

### 5. Linear Algebra:

NumPy provides functions for linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, inversion, and decomposition, which are essential in many data science tasks.

```python
# Matrix multiplication
result = np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)

# Matrix inversion
inverse = np.linalg.inv(matrix)

# Eigenvalue decomposition
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(matrix)
```

### 6. Random Number Generation:

Data scientists often need to generate random numbers for simulations, testing, or creating synthetic datasets.

```python
# Generate random numbers
random_numbers = np.random.rand(100)  # 100 random numbers between 0 and 1
```

These are just a few examples of how NumPy is used in data science. NumPy's versatility and efficiency make it an indispensable tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

You can create an identity matrix using NumPy's `eye` function. An identity matrix is a square matrix with diagonal elements equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0. Here's how you can create an identity matrix using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3x3 identity matrix
identity_matrix = np.eye(3)

print("Identity Matrix:")
print(identity_matrix)
```

This will create a 3x3 identity matrix:

```
Identity Matrix:
[[1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]]
```

You can specify the size of the identity matrix by providing the desired dimension as an argument to the `eye` function. For example, `np.eye(4)` would create a 4x4 identity matrix.

In mathematics and computer science, a tensor is a mathematical object that generalizes scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. Tensors can be represented as multi-dimensional arrays of numerical values.

Here's a breakdown of tensor types based on their dimensions:

1. **Scalar (0-D Tensor):**
   A scalar is a single numerical value, representing a point in space. Scalars have zero dimensions. Examples include a single number like 5 or -2.3.

2. **Vector (1-D Tensor):**
   A vector is an array of numbers arranged in a line. Vectors have one dimension and represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Examples include velocity, displacement, or RGB color values.

3. **Matrix (2-D Tensor):**
   A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices have two dimensions. They are often used to represent linear transformations or data tables.

4. **Tensor (N-D Tensor):**
   A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers. Tensors can have an arbitrary number of dimensions. They are used to represent complex data structures, such as images, audio signals, or datasets in machine learning.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, tensors are fundamental data structures used to represent input data, model parameters, and outputs of neural networks. Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide efficient implementations for tensor operations and make it easy to work with tensors in high-dimensional spaces.

For example, in TensorFlow, you can create tensors using the `tf.Tensor` class:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a scalar tensor
scalar_tensor = tf.constant(5)

# Create a vector tensor
vector_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])

# Create a matrix tensor
matrix_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Create a higher-dimensional tensor
tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
```

Understanding tensors and their operations is crucial for working with deep learning frameworks and implementing various machine learning algorithms.

In NumPy, a tensor is represented as a multi-dimensional array. NumPy arrays provide a flexible way to work with data of any dimensionality. Here's how tensors are represented in NumPy with examples:

### Scalars (0-D Tensor):

A scalar in NumPy is represented as a 0-dimensional array. It contains a single element.

```python
import numpy as np

scalar_tensor = np.array(5)
print("Scalar Tensor (0-D):")
print(scalar_tensor)
```

Output:
```
Scalar Tensor (0-D):
5
```

### Vectors (1-D Tensor):

A vector in NumPy is represented as a 1-dimensional array. It contains elements along a single axis.

```python
vector_tensor = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("Vector Tensor (1-D):")
print(vector_tensor)
```

Output:
```
Vector Tensor (1-D):
[1 2 3]
```

### Matrices (2-D Tensor):

A matrix in NumPy is represented as a 2-dimensional array. It contains elements arranged in rows and columns.

```python
matrix_tensor = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("Matrix Tensor (2-D):")
print(matrix_tensor)
```

Output:
```
Matrix Tensor (2-D):
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
```

### Higher-Dimensional Tensors:

NumPy arrays can have more than two dimensions, representing tensors with higher dimensionality.

```python
# Create a 3-D tensor
tensor_3d = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
print("3-D Tensor:")
print(tensor_3d)
```

Output:
```
3-D Tensor:
[[[1 2]
  [3 4]]

 [[5 6]
  [7 8]]]
```

You can create tensors of arbitrary dimensions using NumPy arrays. Tensors are fundamental data structures in NumPy and are extensively used in various numerical computations, including scientific computing, machine learning, and deep learning.

In NumPy, you can use built-in functions to compute the maximum, minimum, sum, and product of elements in arrays. Here are examples of each:

### 1. Maximum:

To find the maximum value in an array, you can use the `np.max()` function.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8])

max_value = np.max(arr)
print("Maximum value:", max_value)
```

Output:
```
Maximum value: 8
```

### 2. Minimum:

To find the minimum value in an array, you can use the `np.min()` function.

```python
min_value = np.min(arr)
print("Minimum value:", min_value)
```

Output:
```
Minimum value: 1
```

### 3. Sum:

To compute the sum of all elements in an array, you can use the `np.sum()` function.

```python
sum_value = np.sum(arr)
print("Sum of all elements:", sum_value)
```

Output:
```
Sum of all elements: 26
```

### 4. Product:

To compute the product of all elements in an array, you can use the `np.prod()` function.

```python
product_value = np.prod(arr)
print("Product of all elements:", product_value)
```

Output:
```
Product of all elements: 1680
```

These functions work not only for 1-dimensional arrays but also for multi-dimensional arrays. You can specify the axis along which the operation should be performed to compute these statistics along specific axes of the array. For example, `np.max(arr, axis=0)` would compute the maximum value along the first axis (rows) of a 2D array.

In NumPy, the `axis` parameter is used to specify the dimension along which a particular operation should be performed. It allows you to apply operations across different dimensions of a NumPy array.

Here's a breakdown of how the `axis` parameter works in various NumPy functions:

1. **For 1-D Arrays:**
   Since there's only one dimension, the `axis` parameter has no effect.

2. **For 2-D Arrays (Matrices):**
   - `axis=0`: Operations are performed along the rows (i.e., for each column).
   - `axis=1`: Operations are performed along the columns (i.e., for each row).

3. **For Higher-Dimensional Arrays:**
   - The `axis` parameter can take values from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of dimensions.
   - `axis=0`: Operations are performed along the first dimension.
   - `axis=1`: Operations are performed along the second dimension.
   - And so on...

Here are some examples to illustrate the use of the `axis` parameter:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])

# Sum along rows (axis=0)
sum_along_rows = np.sum(arr, axis=0)
print("Sum along rows (axis=0):", sum_along_rows)

# Sum along columns (axis=1)
sum_along_columns = np.sum(arr, axis=1)
print("Sum along columns (axis=1):", sum_along_columns)
```

Output:
```
Sum along rows (axis=0): [5 7 9]
Sum along columns (axis=1): [ 6 15]
```

In this example, when `axis=0`, the sum is computed along the rows, resulting in a 1-D array with the sum of each column. When `axis=1`, the sum is computed along the columns, resulting in a 1-D array with the sum of each row.

Understanding how to use the `axis` parameter is crucial for performing operations along specific dimensions of NumPy arrays efficiently.


In NumPy, you can perform various mathematical operations on arrays, including calculating mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and trigonometric functions. Here's how you can use these functions:

### 1. Mean:

To compute the mean (average) of elements in an array, you can use the `np.mean()` function.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

mean_value = np.mean(arr)
print("Mean:", mean_value)
```

### 2. Median:

To compute the median (middle value) of elements in an array, you can use the `np.median()` function.

```python
median_value = np.median(arr)
print("Median:", median_value)
```

### 3. Standard Deviation:

To compute the standard deviation of elements in an array, you can use the `np.std()` function.

```python
std_deviation = np.std(arr)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_deviation)
```

### 4. Variance:

To compute the variance (average of squared differences from the mean) of elements in an array, you can use the `np.var()` function.

```python
variance_value = np.var(arr)
print("Variance:", variance_value)
```

### 5. Trigonometric Functions:

NumPy provides various trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, etc.

```python
angle = np.pi / 6  # Angle in radians (30 degrees)

# Sine
sin_value = np.sin(angle)
print("Sine:", sin_value)

# Cosine
cos_value = np.cos(angle)
print("Cosine:", cos_value)

# Tangent
tan_value = np.tan(angle)
print("Tangent:", tan_value)
```

These are just a few examples of the many mathematical operations you can perform with NumPy arrays. NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that are optimized for performance and can be applied to arrays of any dimensionality.


In NumPy, you can compute the dot product of two arrays using the `np.dot()` function or the `@` operator. The dot product of two arrays is a scalar value obtained by multiplying corresponding elements and summing up the result.

Here's how you can compute the dot product of two arrays:

### Using `np.dot()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define two arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Compute dot product using np.dot()
dot_product = np.dot(arr1, arr2)

print("Dot Product (np.dot()):", dot_product)
```

### Using `@` operator:

You can also use the `@` operator to compute the dot product of two arrays:

```python
# Compute dot product using @ operator
dot_product = arr1 @ arr2

print("Dot Product (@ operator):", dot_product)
```

Both of these methods will give you the dot product of the two arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`, which is calculated as:

```
1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32
```

Output:
```
Dot Product (np.dot()): 32
Dot Product (@ operator): 32
```

The dot product operation is commonly used in linear algebra and machine learning for tasks such as calculating projections, computing similarity scores, and performing matrix multiplication.

The dot product of a 2x3 matrix and a 3x2 matrix is performed by taking the dot product of each row of the first matrix with each column of the second matrix and summing the results. However, the condition for performing a dot product is that the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.

Let's demonstrate this with an example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 2x3 matrix
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]])

# Define a 3x2 matrix
matrix2 = np.array([[7, 8],
                    [9, 10],
                    [11, 12]])

# Compute the dot product
dot_product = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)

print("Dot Product:")
print(dot_product)
```

In this example, the `matrix1` has dimensions 2x3 and `matrix2` has dimensions 3x2, so they meet the condition for dot product. The resulting matrix `dot_product` will have dimensions 2x2, calculated by multiplying each row of `matrix1` with each column of `matrix2` and summing the results:

```
[1*7 + 2*9 + 3*11, 1*8 + 2*10 + 3*12]
[4*7 + 5*9 + 6*11, 4*8 + 5*10 + 6*12]
```

Output:
```
Dot Product:
[[ 58  64]
 [139 154]]
```

As you can see, the resulting matrix is a 2x2 matrix where each element is the dot product of the corresponding row of `matrix1` with the corresponding column of `matrix2`.

In NumPy, you can compute the natural logarithm and exponential of elements in an array using the `np.log()` and `np.exp()` functions, respectively. Here's how you can use these functions:

### Natural Logarithm (np.log):

The `np.log()` function computes the natural logarithm (base e) of each element in the array.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Compute natural logarithm of elements
log_values = np.log(arr)
print("Natural Logarithm:", log_values)
```

### Exponential (np.exp):

The `np.exp()` function computes the exponential (e^x) of each element in the array.

```python
# Compute exponential of elements
exp_values = np.exp(arr)
print("Exponential:", exp_values)
```

These functions work element-wise on the input array, computing the logarithm or exponential of each individual element. The resulting arrays have the same shape as the input array.

Output:
```
Natural Logarithm: [0.         0.69314718 1.09861229 1.38629436 1.60943791]
Exponential: [  2.71828183   7.3890561   20.08553692  54.59815003 148.4131591 ]
```

In this example, `np.log(arr)` computes the natural logarithm of each element in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and `np.exp(arr)` computes the exponential of each element.

In NumPy, you can perform rounding, flooring, and ceiling operations on array elements using various functions. Here's how you can use these functions:

### Rounding:

The `np.round()` function rounds each element of the array to the nearest integer.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1.2, 2.5, 3.7, 4.1, 5.9])

# Round elements to the nearest integer
rounded_values = np.round(arr)
print("Rounded Values:", rounded_values)
```

### Flooring:

The `np.floor()` function rounds each element of the array down to the nearest integer (toward negative infinity).

```python
# Floor elements (round down)
floor_values = np.floor(arr)
print("Floor Values:", floor_values)
```

### Ceiling:

The `np.ceil()` function rounds each element of the array up to the nearest integer (toward positive infinity).

```python
# Ceiling elements (round up)
ceil_values = np.ceil(arr)
print("Ceiling Values:", ceil_values)
```

These functions work element-wise on the input array, producing arrays with the same shape as the input array.

Output:
```
Rounded Values: [1. 2. 4. 4. 6.]
Floor Values: [1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]
Ceiling Values: [2. 3. 4. 5. 6.]
```

In this example, `np.round(arr)` rounds each element of the array `[1.2, 2.5, 3.7, 4.1, 5.9]` to the nearest integer, `np.floor(arr)` rounds each element down, and `np.ceil(arr)` rounds each element up.

Indexing and slicing are fundamental operations in NumPy arrays that allow you to access and manipulate elements of the array. Here's how you can perform indexing and slicing in NumPy:

### Indexing:

Indexing in NumPy arrays works similarly to Python lists. You can access individual elements of an array using square brackets `[]` and the index of the element you want to access. Indexing is zero-based, meaning the index of the first element is 0.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Access individual elements
print("First element:", arr[0])  # First element
print("Third element:", arr[2])  # Third element
print("Last element:", arr[-1])  # Last element
```

### Slicing:

Slicing allows you to extract a subset of elements from an array. You can specify a range of indices using the slice notation `[start:end:step]`, where `start` is the starting index, `end` is the ending index (exclusive), and `step` is the step size.

```python
# Define a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Slice the array
print("Slice from index 1 to 3:", arr[1:4])  # [2, 3, 4]
print("Slice from index 0 to 4 with step 2:", arr[0:5:2])  # [1, 3, 5]
```

You can omit `start`, `end`, or `step` in the slice notation. If `start` is omitted, it defaults to 0. If `end` is omitted, it defaults to the length of the array. If `step` is omitted, it defaults to 1.

### Slicing Multi-Dimensional Arrays:

For multi-dimensional arrays, you can use slicing along each axis to extract subsets of elements.

```python
# Define a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Slice the array along rows and columns
print("First row:", arr_2d[0])  # First row
print("Second column:", arr_2d[:, 1])  # Second column
print("Sub-array:", arr_2d[1:3, 0:2])  # Sub-array
```

These are the basics of indexing and slicing in NumPy arrays. They provide powerful ways to access and manipulate data efficiently in array operations.

Certainly! Slicing in multidimensional NumPy arrays allows you to extract subsets of elements along different axes. Each axis can be sliced independently to specify the range of elements you want to select. Let's go through some examples to understand slicing in multidimensional arrays:

### 1. Slicing along Rows and Columns:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 2D array (3x3)
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Slice along rows and columns
print("Original Array:")
print(arr_2d)

# Slicing along rows (axis 0)
print("\nFirst row:")
print(arr_2d[0])  # Selects the first row

# Slicing along columns (axis 1)
print("\nSecond column:")
print(arr_2d[:, 1])  # Selects the second column

# Slicing a sub-array
print("\nSub-array (2nd and 3rd rows, 1st and 2nd columns):")
print(arr_2d[1:3, 0:2])  # Selects a sub-array
```

Output:
```
Original Array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

First row:
[1 2 3]

Second column:
[2 5 8]

Sub-array (2nd and 3rd rows, 1st and 2nd columns):
[[4 5]
 [7 8]]
```

### 2. Slicing Higher-Dimensional Arrays:

Slicing works similarly for arrays with more than two dimensions. You can specify slices along each axis to extract subsets of elements.

```python
# Define a 3D array (3x3x3)
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6],
                    [7, 8, 9]],
                   [[10, 11, 12],
                    [13, 14, 15],
                    [16, 17, 18]],
                   [[19, 20, 21],
                    [22, 23, 24],
                    [25, 26, 27]]])

# Slicing along each axis
print("\nOriginal 3D Array:")
print(arr_3d)

print("\nSlice along first axis (selecting second 2D array):")
print(arr_3d[1, :, :])

print("\nSlice along second axis (selecting second column from each 2D array):")
print(arr_3d[:, :, 1])

print("\nSlice along third axis (selecting first two elements from each row in each 2D array):")
print(arr_3d[:, :, 0:2])
```

Output:
```
Original 3D Array:
[[[ 1  2  3]
  [ 4  5  6]
  [ 7  8  9]]

 [[10 11 12]
  [13 14 15]
  [16 17 18]]

 [[19 20 21]
  [22 23 24]
  [25 26 27]]]

Slice along first axis (selecting second 2D array):
[[10 11 12]
 [13 14 15]
 [16 17 18]]

Slice along second axis (selecting second column from each 2D array):
[[ 2  5  8]
 [11 14 17]
 [20 23 26]]

Slice along third axis (selecting first two elements from each row in each 2D array):
[[[ 1  2]
  [ 4  5]
  [ 7  8]]

 [[10 11]
  [13 14]
  [16 17]]

 [[19 20]
  [22 23]
  [25 26]]]
```

These examples demonstrate how to slice multidimensional NumPy arrays along different axes to extract subsets of elements. Slicing is a powerful tool for data manipulation and subsetting in array operations.
Remembering slicing syntax for multidimensional arrays can be facilitated by understanding the general pattern of indexing along different axes. Here's a mnemonic to help remember slicing in 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays:

### 1. 1D Array (Vector):
- **Syntax:** `array[start:end:step]`
- **Mnemonic:** Think of slicing along a single dimension, from the `start` index to the `end` index with a specified `step`.

### 2. 2D Array (Matrix):
- **Syntax:** `array[start_row:end_row:step_row, start_col:end_col:step_col]`
- **Mnemonic:** Visualize slicing as a rectangular region within the matrix, specified by rows and columns. You're essentially specifying a range of rows (`start_row:end_row:step_row`) and a range of columns (`start_col:end_col:step_col`).

### 3. 3D Array (Tensor):
- **Syntax:** `array[start_axis0:end_axis0:step_axis0, start_axis1:end_axis1:step_axis1, start_axis2:end_axis2:step_axis2]`
- **Mnemonic:** Think of slicing as cutting through a block of data along three different axes. Each axis (`axis0`, `axis1`, `axis2`) corresponds to a different dimension of the tensor. You're specifying ranges along each axis to extract a sub-tensor.

By visualizing the slicing operation as cutting through the data along different dimensions, you can remember the syntax more easily for 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays. Additionally, practice and repetition will reinforce your understanding and familiarity with slicing operations in NumPy.

Iterating over elements in NumPy arrays can be done using loops, such as `for` loops, or using the `numpy.nditer()` function for more efficient iteration. Let's go through examples of iterating over 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays:

### 1. Iterating over a 1D Array:

```python
import numpy as np

arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Using a for loop
print("1D Array:")
for elem in arr_1d:
    print(elem)

# Using numpy.nditer()
print("\n1D Array (using nditer):")
for elem in np.nditer(arr_1d):
    print(elem)
```

### 2. Iterating over a 2D Array:

```python
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Using a for loop
print("\n2D Array:")
for row in arr_2d:
    for elem in row:
        print(elem, end=" ")
    print()

# Using numpy.nditer()
print("\n2D Array (using nditer):")
for elem in np.nditer(arr_2d):
    print(elem, end=" ")
```

### 3. Iterating over a 3D Array:

```python
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2],
                    [3, 4]],
                   [[5, 6],
                    [7, 8]],
                   [[9, 10],
                    [11, 12]]])

# Using a for loop
print("\n\n3D Array:")
for matrix in arr_3d:
    for row in matrix:
        for elem in row:
            print(elem, end=" ")
        print()

# Using numpy.nditer()
print("\n3D Array (using nditer):")
for elem in np.nditer(arr_3d):
    print(elem, end=" ")
```

In each example:
- The first loop demonstrates how to iterate using a traditional `for` loop.
- The second loop demonstrates how to iterate using `numpy.nditer()`, which is more efficient, especially for large arrays.
- In 2D and 3D arrays, nested loops are used to traverse rows and columns or matrices within the array.

The `numpy.nditer()` function provides an efficient way to iterate over elements in NumPy arrays while preserving the data layout and ensuring better performance, especially for large arrays.

Certainly! Iterating over NumPy arrays can be done using loops such as `for` loops, or using the `numpy.nditer()` function, which provides more efficient iteration, especially for large arrays. Let's go through examples of iterating over 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays using both methods:

### 1. Iterating over a 1D Array:

```python
import numpy as np

arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Using a for loop
print("1D Array (for loop):")
for elem in arr_1d:
    print(elem)

# Using numpy.nditer()
print("\n1D Array (numpy.nditer()):")
for elem in np.nditer(arr_1d):
    print(elem)
```

### 2. Iterating over a 2D Array:

```python
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Using a for loop
print("\n2D Array (for loop):")
for row in arr_2d:
    for elem in row:
        print(elem, end=" ")
    print()

# Using numpy.nditer()
print("\n2D Array (numpy.nditer()):")
for elem in np.nditer(arr_2d):
    print(elem, end=" ")
```

### 3. Iterating over a 3D Array:

```python
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2],
                    [3, 4]],
                   [[5, 6],
                    [7, 8]],
                   [[9, 10],
                    [11, 12]]])

# Using a for loop
print("\n\n3D Array (for loop):")
for matrix in arr_3d:
    for row in matrix:
        for elem in row:
            print(elem, end=" ")
        print()

# Using numpy.nditer()
print("\n3D Array (numpy.nditer()):")
for elem in np.nditer(arr_3d):
    print(elem, end=" ")
```

In each example:
- The first loop demonstrates how to iterate using a traditional `for` loop.
- The second loop demonstrates how to iterate using `numpy.nditer()`, which is more efficient, especially for large arrays.
- In 2D and 3D arrays, nested loops are used to traverse rows and columns or matrices within the array.

Using `numpy.nditer()` is more efficient, especially for large arrays, as it provides better performance and memory locality compared to nested loops. It also allows for more flexible iteration patterns and supports various iteration order options.

Sure! Let's discuss `reshape`, `transpose`, and `ravel` operations in NumPy arrays, along with examples:

### 1. Reshape:

The `reshape` function in NumPy allows you to change the shape (dimensions) of an array without changing its data. It returns a new array with the specified shape. Here's how you can use it:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Reshape the array to a 2D array (3 rows, 2 columns)
arr_2d = arr_1d.reshape(3, 2)

print("Original 1D Array:")
print(arr_1d)

print("\nReshaped 2D Array:")
print(arr_2d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D Array:
[1 2 3 4 5 6]

Reshaped 2D Array:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
```

### 2. Transpose:

The `transpose` function in NumPy allows you to reverse or permute the axes of an array. For 2D arrays, it effectively swaps rows and columns. Here's an example:

```python
# Transpose the 2D array
arr_transposed = arr_2d.transpose()

print("Original 2D Array:")
print(arr_2d)

print("\nTransposed 2D Array:")
print(arr_transposed)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D Array:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]

Transposed 2D Array:
[[1 3 5]
 [2 4 6]]
```

### 3. Ravel:

The `ravel` function in NumPy returns a flattened (1D) view of an array, containing all elements of the original array in a single dimension. It does not create a copy of the data; instead, it provides a view of the original array's data. Here's an example:

```python
# Flatten the 2D array to a 1D array
arr_flattened = arr_2d.ravel()

print("Original 2D Array:")
print(arr_2d)

print("\nFlattened 1D Array:")
print(arr_flattened)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D Array:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]

Flattened 1D Array:
[1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

These operations - `reshape`, `transpose`, and `ravel` - are useful for manipulating the shape and structure of NumPy arrays, enabling various data processing and analysis tasks.

In NumPy, stacking refers to the process of combining arrays along a new axis. There are several stacking functions available in NumPy, including `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()`, `np.dstack()`, and `np.stack()`, each serving different purposes for stacking arrays vertically, horizontally, depth-wise, or along a new axis, respectively.

Let's go through each stacking function with examples:

### 1. `np.vstack()` (Vertical Stack):

This function stacks arrays vertically (row-wise), combining them along the first axis (axis 0). It requires the shapes of the arrays to be compatible along the second axis (axis 1).

```python
import numpy as np

# Define two 1D arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Stack arrays vertically
vertical_stack = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))

print("Vertical Stack:")
print(vertical_stack)
```

Output:
```
Vertical Stack:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
```

### 2. `np.hstack()` (Horizontal Stack):

This function stacks arrays horizontally (column-wise), combining them along the second axis (axis 1). It requires the shapes of the arrays to be compatible along the first axis (axis 0).

```python
# Define two 1D arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Stack arrays horizontally
horizontal_stack = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))

print("Horizontal Stack:")
print(horizontal_stack)
```

Output:
```
Horizontal Stack:
[1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

### 3. `np.dstack()` (Depth-wise Stack):

This function stacks arrays depth-wise (along the third axis), combining them along the last axis (axis 2). It requires the shapes of the arrays to be compatible along the first two axes.

```python
# Define two 2D arrays
arr1 = np.array([[1, 2],
                 [3, 4]])
arr2 = np.array([[5, 6],
                 [7, 8]])

# Stack arrays depth-wise
depth_stack = np.dstack((arr1, arr2))

print("Depth-wise Stack:")
print(depth_stack)
```

Output:
```
Depth-wise Stack:
[[[1 5]
  [2 6]]

 [[3 7]
  [4 8]]]
```

### 4. `np.stack()` (Generalized Stacking):

This function stacks arrays along a new axis, which is specified by the `axis` parameter. It requires the shapes of the arrays to be compatible along all axes except the one being stacked.

```python
# Define two 1D arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Stack arrays along a new axis (axis=0)
stacked_arrays = np.stack((arr1, arr2), axis=0)

print("Stacked Arrays along a New Axis:")
print(stacked_arrays)
```

Output:
```
Stacked Arrays along a New Axis:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
```

These stacking functions provide versatile ways to combine arrays in different dimensions, enabling various data manipulation tasks in NumPy.

In NumPy, splitting refers to the process of breaking an array into multiple smaller arrays along a specified axis. NumPy provides several functions for splitting arrays, including `np.split()`, `np.hsplit()`, `np.vsplit()`, and `np.dsplit()` for splitting arrays horizontally, vertically, or depth-wise, respectively.

Let's go through each splitting function with examples:

### 1. `np.split()` (Split along specified axis):

This function splits an array into multiple sub-arrays along a specified axis. You need to provide the array to split and the indices or sections at which to split.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Split the array into three sub-arrays
sub_arrays = np.split(arr, 3)

print("Split Sub-arrays:")
for sub_arr in sub_arrays:
    print(sub_arr)
```

Output:
```
Split Sub-arrays:
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]
```

### 2. `np.hsplit()` (Horizontal Split):

This function splits an array horizontally (column-wise) along the second axis (axis 1).

```python
# Define a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]])

# Split the array horizontally into two sub-arrays
sub_arrays = np.hsplit(arr, 2)

print("Horizontal Split Sub-arrays:")
for sub_arr in sub_arrays:
    print(sub_arr)
```

Output:
```
Horizontal Split Sub-arrays:
[[1 2]
 [4 5]
 [7 8]]
[[3]
 [6]
 [9]]
```

### 3. `np.vsplit()` (Vertical Split):

This function splits an array vertically (row-wise) along the first axis (axis 0).

```python
# Define a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]])

# Split the array vertically into three sub-arrays
sub_arrays = np.vsplit(arr, 3)

print("Vertical Split Sub-arrays:")
for sub_arr in sub_arrays:
    print(sub_arr)
```

Output:
```
Vertical Split Sub-arrays:
[[1 2 3]]
[[4 5 6]]
[[7 8 9]]
```

### 4. `np.dsplit()` (Depth-wise Split):

This function splits an array depth-wise (along the third axis) into multiple sub-arrays.

```python
# Define a 3D array
arr = np.array([[[1, 2],
                 [3, 4]],
                [[5, 6],
                 [7, 8]],
                [[9, 10],
                 [11, 12]]])

# Split the array depth-wise into two sub-arrays
sub_arrays = np.dsplit(arr, 2)

print("Depth-wise Split Sub-arrays:")
for sub_arr in sub_arrays:
    print(sub_arr)
```

Output:
```
Depth-wise Split Sub-arrays:
[[[ 1]
  [ 3]]

 [[ 5]
  [ 7]]

 [[ 9]
  [11]]]
[[[ 2]
  [ 4]]

 [[ 6]
  [ 8]]

 [[10]
  [12]]]
```

These splitting functions provide versatile ways to split arrays along different axes, enabling various data manipulation tasks in NumPy.

Numpy arrays and Python lists are both used for storing collections of elements, but they have some key differences:

1. **Homogeneity:**
   - Numpy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type. This allows for more efficient storage and operations on the data.
   - Python lists can hold elements of different data types, providing more flexibility but potentially leading to less efficient numerical operations.

2. **Performance:**
   - Numpy arrays are more efficient for numerical operations and large datasets due to their homogeneous nature and optimized implementation in C.
   - Python lists may be slower for numerical operations, especially when dealing with large datasets, because they are more general-purpose and not optimized for specific tasks.

3. **Syntax and Convenience:**
   - Numpy provides a variety of functions and methods optimized for array operations, making it more convenient for numerical computations.
   - Lists have a more general-purpose syntax and offer a broader range of functionalities for general data manipulation.

4. **Memory Usage:**
   - Numpy arrays are more memory-efficient compared to Python lists, especially for large datasets, as they store data in contiguous memory blocks.
   - Python lists may have more overhead due to their general-purpose nature and the need to store information about each element.

5. **Functionality:**
   - Numpy arrays provide a wide range of mathematical functions and operations, making them suitable for scientific computing and numerical analysis.
   - Lists are more versatile for general tasks but lack specialized functionality for numerical operations.

In summary, if your task involves numerical computations, especially with large datasets, and you need efficiency, Numpy arrays are a better choice. However, if you need a more flexible and general-purpose data structure, Python lists might be more suitable. Often, a combination of both is used, taking advantage of the strengths of each when necessary.

Fancy indexing in NumPy refers to the use of arrays or other iterable objects as indices to access or modify elements of an array. Unlike basic indexing, where you use integers or slices, fancy indexing allows you to use arrays of indices to perform more advanced and flexible operations on NumPy arrays.

There are two main types of fancy indexing:

1. **Integer Array Indexing:**
   - You can use an array of integers as indices to extract specific elements from an array.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import numpy as np

     arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
     indices = np.array([1, 3, 4])

     result = arr[indices]
     print(result)  # Output: [20 40 50]
     ```
   - In this example, the elements at indices 1, 3, and 4 are extracted from the original array.

2. **Boolean Array Indexing:**
   - You can use boolean arrays to filter elements based on a condition.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import numpy as np

     arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
     condition = arr > 30

     result = arr[condition]
     print(result)  # Output: [40 50]
     ```
   - Here, a boolean array is created based on the condition (elements greater than 30), and then the elements that satisfy the condition are extracted.

Fancy indexing provides a powerful way to manipulate arrays by selecting, modifying, or rearranging elements based on more complex criteria. It is important to note that fancy indexing creates a new array with a copy of the data rather than a view of the original data, so modifications to the fancy indexed array do not affect the original array.

Certainly! Let's explore fancy indexing with 2D and 3D NumPy arrays.

### Fancy Indexing with 2D Arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Integer Array Indexing in 2D array
row_indices = np.array([0, 1, 2])
col_indices = np.array([1, 2, 0])

result_2d = arr_2d[row_indices, col_indices]
print(result_2d)
```

In this example, we use integer array indexing to select elements from the 2D array. `row_indices` represent the indices of rows, and `col_indices` represent the indices of columns. The resulting array would be `[2, 6, 7]`, representing elements at positions (0,1), (1,2), and (2,0).

### Fancy Indexing with 3D Arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 3D array
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
                   [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]],
                   [[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]]])

# Integer Array Indexing in 3D array
depth_indices = np.array([0, 2])
row_indices = np.array([1, 0])
col_indices = np.array([2, 1])

result_3d = arr_3d[depth_indices, row_indices, col_indices]
print(result_3d)
```

In this example, the 3D array is indexed using arrays for depth, row, and column indices. The resulting array would be `[6, 14]`, representing elements at positions (0,1,2) and (2,0,1).

Fancy indexing provides a flexible way to access elements in higher-dimensional arrays based on specified criteria or patterns. It allows for more complex and customized operations on multi-dimensional data structures.

Boolean indexing in NumPy involves using boolean arrays to select or filter elements based on a condition. This is a powerful mechanism for extracting or modifying elements in an array based on specific criteria.

### Boolean Indexing with 1D Array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Boolean Array Indexing in 1D array
condition = arr_1d > 30
result_1d = arr_1d[condition]

print(result_1d)
```

In this example, a boolean array (`condition`) is created based on the condition that elements in `arr_1d` are greater than 30. The resulting array would be `[40, 50]`.

### Boolean Indexing with 2D Array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Boolean Array Indexing in 2D array
condition = arr_2d > 5
result_2d = arr_2d[condition]

print(result_2d)
```

In this example, a boolean array (`condition`) is created based on the condition that elements in `arr_2d` are greater than 5. The resulting array would be `[6, 7, 8, 9]`.

### Boolean Indexing with 3D Array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 3D array
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
                   [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]],
                   [[13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]]])

# Boolean Array Indexing in 3D array
condition = arr_3d % 2 == 0
result_3d = arr_3d[condition]

print(result_3d)
```

In this example, a boolean array (`condition`) is created based on the condition that elements in `arr_3d` are even. The resulting array would contain all the even elements from the original 3D array.

Boolean indexing allows for dynamic and expressive selection of elements in an array based on logical conditions, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy broadcasting is a mechanism that allows for arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes, without the need for explicit replication or copying of data. This feature makes it possible to perform operations on arrays that don't have the same shape, as long as their dimensions are compatible according to certain rules.

### Broadcasting Rules:

1. **Dimensions Compatibility:**
   - Dimensions are compared element-wise, starting from the right. Two dimensions are compatible when either they are equal or one of them is 1.

2. **Size Compatibility:**
   - Arrays with a size of 1 in a particular dimension can be expanded to match the size of the other array in that dimension.

### Broadcasting Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Broadcasting with a scalar
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
scalar = 2

result1 = arr1 * scalar
print(result1)
# Output: [2 4 6]

# Example 2: Broadcasting with a 1D array
arr2 = np.array([10, 20, 30])
arr3 = np.array([2])

result2 = arr2 + arr3
print(result2)
# Output: [12 22 32]
```

In Example 1, the scalar `2` is broadcasted to the 1D array `arr1`, resulting in element-wise multiplication.

In Example 2, the 1D array `arr3` is broadcasted to the 1D array `arr2`, making their shapes compatible for addition.

### Broadcasting with 2D Arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 3: Broadcasting with 2D arrays
arr4 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])

arr5 = np.array([10, 20, 30])

result3 = arr4 + arr5
print(result3)
# Output:
# [[11 22 33]
#  [14 25 36]]
```

In Example 3, the 1D array `arr5` is broadcasted to each row of the 2D array `arr4` for addition. Broadcasting expands the dimensions of `arr5` to match the shape of `arr4` for the operation.

Broadcasting simplifies operations on arrays with different shapes, reducing the need for explicit reshaping or copying. However, it's crucial to understand the rules and ensure that dimensions are compatible for broadcasting to work correctly.

Certainly! NumPy is powerful for mathematical computations, and you can use it to apply mathematical formulas efficiently to arrays. Let's go through an example using a simple mathematical formula.

### Example: Squaring Elements in an Array

Suppose you have an array `arr` and you want to square each element of the array using a mathematical formula \(y = x^2\), where \(x\) is the original element, and \(y\) is the squared result.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Applying the mathematical formula using NumPy
squared_arr = arr ** 2

print(squared_arr)
```

Output:
```
[ 1  4  9 16 25]
```

In this example, the mathematical formula \(y = x^2\) is applied element-wise to the NumPy array `arr` using the `**` operator. The result is a new array `squared_arr` where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original array.

### Example: Computing Sine of Elements

Let's consider another example where you want to compute the sine of each element in a NumPy array.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
angles_degrees = np.array([30, 45, 60, 90])

# Converting degrees to radians and computing sine
angles_radians = np.radians(angles_degrees)
sine_values = np.sin(angles_radians)

print(sine_values)
```

Output:
```
[0.5        0.70710678 0.8660254  1.        ]
```

In this example, the mathematical formula \(y = \sin(x)\) is applied to each element in the `angles_degrees` array. First, the angles are converted to radians using `np.radians`, and then the sine values are computed using `np.sin`.

NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can be applied to arrays, making it a powerful tool for numerical and scientific computing.

The sigmoid function is a common activation function used in machine learning, especially in binary classification problems. The sigmoid function maps any real-valued number to the range (0, 1). It is defined by the formula:

\[ \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \]

In NumPy, you can implement the sigmoid function and apply it to a NumPy array as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example usage
array_to_apply_sigmoid = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])
result = sigmoid(array_to_apply_sigmoid)

print(result)
```

Output:
```
[0.11920292 0.26894142 0.5        0.73105858 0.88079708]
```

In this example, the `sigmoid` function is defined to apply the sigmoid transformation element-wise to a NumPy array. The result is a new array where each element has been transformed according to the sigmoid function.

Dealing with missing values in NumPy arrays often involves using NumPy's `nan` (not a number) representation or functions specifically designed for handling missing values. Here are a few techniques:

### 1. Using `numpy.nan`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Check for NaN values
nan_mask = np.isnan(arr_with_nan)

# Replace NaN values with a specific value
arr_with_nan[nan_mask] = 0

print(arr_with_nan)
```

In this example, we create an array with a NaN value, identify the NaN values using `np.isnan`, and then replace the NaN value with 0.

### 2. Filtering out NaN values:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Filter out NaN values
arr_filtered = arr_with_nan[~np.isnan(arr_with_nan)]

print(arr_filtered)
```

Here, we use boolean indexing to filter out NaN values from the array.

### 3. Ignoring NaN values in calculations:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Calculate the mean, ignoring NaN values
mean_value = np.nanmean(arr_with_nan)

print(mean_value)
```

`np.nanmean` is a function that calculates the mean while ignoring NaN values.

Handling missing values often involves a combination of these techniques depending on the specific use case. Be cautious about how you handle missing values, and choose the method that aligns with the requirements of your analysis or application.

Certainly! Dealing with missing values in NumPy often involves using functions designed to handle or manipulate arrays with NaN (Not a Number) values. Here are some additional techniques and functions:

### 1. **Identifying NaN values:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Check for NaN values
nan_mask = np.isnan(arr_with_nan)

print(nan_mask)
```

This will output a boolean array indicating the positions of NaN values.

### 2. **Replacing NaN with a specific value:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Replace NaN values with a specific value
arr_with_nan[np.isnan(arr_with_nan)] = -1

print(arr_with_nan)
```

Replace NaN values with a specified value (in this case, -1).

### 3. **Filtering out NaN values:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Filter out NaN values
arr_filtered = arr_with_nan[~np.isnan(arr_with_nan)]

print(arr_filtered)
```

Use boolean indexing to filter out NaN values from the array.

### 4. **Checking if any NaN values exist:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Check if any NaN values exist
has_nan = np.any(np.isnan(arr_with_nan))

print(has_nan)
```

Use `np.any` to check if there are any NaN values in the array.

### 5. **Calculations with NaN-aware functions:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with missing values
arr_with_nan = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])

# Calculate mean ignoring NaN values
mean_value = np.nanmean(arr_with_nan)

# Sum ignoring NaN values
sum_value = np.nansum(arr_with_nan)

print("Mean:", mean_value)
print("Sum:", sum_value)
```

Use `np.nanmean` and `np.nansum` for calculations, which ignore NaN values.

These functions provide a robust way to handle missing values in NumPy arrays, and choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific requirements of your analysis or application.

NumPy itself is not a plotting library, but it is often used in conjunction with libraries like Matplotlib to create plots and graphs. Here's a simple example of creating a plot using NumPy and Matplotlib:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a NumPy array for x values
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)  # Create 100 points from 0 to 2*pi

# Create a NumPy array for y values using a mathematical function (sin in this case)
y = np.sin(x)

# Plotting the data
plt.plot(x, y, label='Sin(x)')

# Adding labels and title
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Sine Function')

# Adding a legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

In this example:

1. `np.linspace` creates an array of evenly spaced values over a specified range.
2. `np.sin` calculates the sine of each element in the array.
3. `plt.plot` is used to create the plot.
4. `plt.xlabel`, `plt.ylabel`, and `plt.title` add labels and a title.
5. `plt.legend` adds a legend.
6. `plt.show` displays the plot.

Make sure you have Matplotlib installed (`pip install matplotlib`) before running this code.

This is just a basic example. Depending on your data and visualization needs, you can explore various plotting functions provided by Matplotlib or other plotting libraries compatible with NumPy, such as Seaborn.

`numpy.linspace` is a function in the NumPy library that creates an array of evenly spaced values over a specified range. The basic syntax of `linspace` is:

```python
numpy.linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False, dtype=None, axis=0)
```

- `start`: The starting value of the sequence.
- `stop`: The end value of the sequence.
- `num`: The number of evenly spaced values to generate. Default is 50.
- `endpoint`: If True, `stop` is the last value in the range; if False, it is not included. Default is True.
- `retstep`: If True, return the step size between values as well. Default is False.
- `dtype`: The data type of the output array.
- `axis`: The axis in the result along which the linspace samples are stored. The default is 0.

Here's an example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array with 10 values evenly spaced between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
arr = np.linspace(0, 1, num=10)

print(arr)
```

Output:
```
[0.         0.11111111 0.22222222 0.33333333 0.44444444 0.55555556
 0.66666667 0.77777778 0.88888889 1.        ]
```

In this example, `linspace` generates an array with 10 values evenly spaced between 0 and 1. The `num` parameter controls the number of values in the array. The `endpoint` parameter determines whether the end value (1.0 in this case) is included in the array.

`linspace` is commonly used in creating sample points for plotting graphs, numerical simulations, and other applications where evenly spaced values are required.

`numpy.meshgrid` is a function in the NumPy library that creates coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors. It is particularly useful for creating 2D grids for evaluating functions or creating 3D plots. The basic syntax of `meshgrid` is:

```python
numpy.meshgrid(*xi, copy=True, sparse=False, indexing='xy')
```

- `*xi`: The input coordinates. You can pass multiple coordinate vectors.
- `copy`: If False, a view into the original vectors is returned. If True, a new array is created. Default is True.
- `sparse`: If True, the output arrays will be in a sparse matrix format. Default is False.
- `indexing`: Specifies the indexing of the output matrices. 'xy' means (i, j) indexing for output matrices.

Here's an example:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a grid of 2D coordinates
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)

# Create a meshgrid from x and y
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Evaluate a function over the grid (e.g., a 2D Gaussian)
Z = np.exp(-(X**2 + Y**2) / 10)

# Plot the 2D Gaussian
plt.contourf(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('2D Gaussian')

plt.show()
```

In this example:

1. `np.linspace` creates arrays of evenly spaced values for `x` and `y`.
2. `np.meshgrid(x, y)` creates 2D coordinate matrices `X` and `Y`.
3. The function \(Z = \exp\left(-\frac{X^2 + Y^2}{10}\right)\) is evaluated over the grid.
4. `plt.contourf` is used to create a filled contour plot.

The resulting plot visualizes a 2D Gaussian distribution over the created grid.

`meshgrid` is beneficial for creating input grids for functions that depend on multiple variables and for generating coordinates for 3D plots.

Certainly! Let's dive into more detail with an example of using `numpy.meshgrid`:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create coordinate vectors
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)

# Create a meshgrid using numpy.meshgrid
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Define a function that depends on X and Y (e.g., a 2D Gaussian)
def gaussian_2d(x, y, mu_x=0, mu_y=0, sigma_x=1, sigma_y=1):
    return np.exp(-((x - mu_x)**2 / (2 * sigma_x**2) + (y - mu_y)**2 / (2 * sigma_y**2)))

# Evaluate the 2D Gaussian function over the grid
Z = gaussian_2d(X, Y, mu_x=1, mu_y=2, sigma_x=2, sigma_y=0.5)

# Plotting the 2D Gaussian
plt.contourf(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', levels=20)
plt.colorbar()
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('2D Gaussian Distribution')

plt.show()
```

In this example:

1. `np.linspace` creates evenly spaced vectors `x` and `y`.
2. `np.meshgrid(x, y)` creates 2D coordinate matrices `X` and `Y` representing the grid.
3. We define a 2D Gaussian function `gaussian_2d` that takes `X` and `Y` as inputs.
4. The function is evaluated over the grid to generate `Z`, the values of the 2D Gaussian.
5. `plt.contourf` is used to create a filled contour plot.

Adjust the parameters of the Gaussian function or try different functions depending on your needs. This example demonstrates how `numpy.meshgrid` is useful for creating input grids for 2D functions and visualizing the results.
`np.sort` is a NumPy function that returns a sorted copy of an array along a specified axis. The function can operate on 1D arrays, 2D arrays, or higher-dimensional arrays. The basic syntax of `np.sort` is:

```python
numpy.sort(a, axis=-1, kind=None, order=None)
```

- `a`: The input array to be sorted.
- `axis`: The axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means the last axis.
- `kind`: The sorting algorithm. Default is 'quicksort'.
- `order`: For structured arrays, specify the field to use when sorting.

Here's an example using `np.sort`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3])

# Use np.sort to get a sorted copy of the array
sorted_arr_1d = np.sort(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Sorted 1D array:", sorted_arr_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3]
Sorted 1D array: [1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 9]
```

In this example, `np.sort` is applied to a 1D array (`arr_1d`), and a new sorted array (`sorted_arr_1d`) is returned. The original array remains unchanged.

You can also use `np.sort` along a specific axis for multi-dimensional arrays:

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[5, 4, 3],
                   [2, 1, 0]])

# Use np.sort along the last axis (axis=-1)
sorted_arr_2d = np.sort(arr_2d, axis=-1)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nSorted 2D array along the last axis:")
print(sorted_arr_2d)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[5 4 3]
 [2 1 0]]

Sorted 2D array along the last axis:
[[3 4 5]
 [0 1 2]]
```

In this example, `np.sort` is applied along the last axis (axis=-1), which corresponds to sorting each row individually.

Note that `np.sort` returns a sorted copy of the array; if you want to sort the array in-place, you can use the `sort` method of the array itself:

```python
arr_1d.sort()  # In-place sorting for a 1D array
print("Sorted 1D array in-place:", arr_1d)
```

In NumPy, you can perform both ascending and descending array sorting using the `np.sort` function or the `sort` method of a NumPy array. I'll explain both in detail:

### 1. Ascending Sorting:

#### Using `np.sort`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3])

# Ascending sort using np.sort
sorted_arr_ascending = np.sort(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Sorted 1D array (ascending):", sorted_arr_ascending)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3]
Sorted 1D array (ascending): [1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 9]
```

#### Using `sort` method:

```python
# Ascending sort using the sort method
arr_1d.sort()

print("Sorted 1D array in-place (ascending):", arr_1d)
```

Output:
```
Sorted 1D array in-place (ascending): [1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 9]
```

### 2. Descending Sorting:

#### Using `np.sort` with slicing:

```python
# Descending sort using np.sort and slicing
sorted_arr_descending = np.sort(arr_1d)[::-1]

print("Sorted 1D array (descending):", sorted_arr_descending)
```

Output:
```
Sorted 1D array (descending): [9 6 5 5 4 3 3 2 1 1]
```

#### Using `sort` method with `[::-1]`:

```python
# Descending sort using the sort method with slicing
arr_1d.sort()[::-1]

print("Sorted 1D array in-place (descending):", arr_1d)
```

Output:
```
Sorted 1D array in-place (descending): [9 6 5 5 4 3 3 2 1 1]
```

In both cases, the `[::-1]` slicing reverses the order of the sorted array, effectively achieving descending sorting.

For 2D arrays or arrays with more dimensions, you can specify the axis along which the sorting should be done using the `axis` parameter:

```python
# Creating a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[5, 4, 3],
                   [2, 1, 0]])

# Descending sort along the last axis (axis=-1)
sorted_arr_descending_2d = np.sort(arr_2d, axis=-1)[:, ::-1]

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nSorted 2D array along the last axis (descending):")
print(sorted_arr_descending_2d)
```

In this example, `[:, ::-1]` reverses the order of elements along the last axis (columns) for descending sorting.

`numpy.append` is a function in the NumPy library that appends values to the end of an array. It can be used to concatenate arrays along a specified axis. The basic syntax of `numpy.append` is:

```python
numpy.append(arr, values, axis=None)
```

- `arr`: The input array.
- `values`: Values to be appended to `arr`. This can be a scalar, an array, or a list of values.
- `axis`: The axis along which values are appended. If not specified, the input array is flattened before appending.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `numpy.append`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Appending a single value to a 1D array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
value_to_append = 4
result1 = np.append(arr1, value_to_append)

print("Original 1D array:", arr1)
print("Result after appending a single value:", result1)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [1 2 3]
Result after appending a single value: [1 2 3 4]
```

In this example, a single value (4) is appended to the end of a 1D array (`arr1`).

```python
# Example 2: Appending an array to another array along a specified axis
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])

values_to_append = np.array([[7, 8, 9],
                             [10, 11, 12]])

# Append along axis=0 (rows)
result2_axis_0 = np.append(arr2, values_to_append, axis=0)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr2)
print("\nResult after appending along axis=0:")
print(result2_axis_0)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Result after appending along axis=0:
[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]
```

In this example, a 2D array (`values_to_append`) is appended to another 2D array (`arr2`) along `axis=0` (rows).

**Important Notes:**

- `numpy.append` returns a new array; it does not modify the original array in place.
- If `axis` is not specified, the input arrays are flattened before appending.
- Appending along different axes may require the arrays to have compatible shapes along the specified axis.
- For more complex concatenation, consider using `numpy.concatenate` or `numpy.vstack`/`numpy.hstack` for vertical and horizontal stacking.

Keep in mind that repeated use of `numpy.append` for large arrays in a loop can be inefficient due to the creation of new arrays at each step. In such cases, it's often more efficient to collect the arrays in a list and then concatenate them using `numpy.concatenate` or other appropriate functions.

`numpy.concatenate` is a function in the NumPy library that concatenates arrays along a specified axis. It allows you to combine multiple arrays into a single array. The basic syntax of `numpy.concatenate` is:

```python
numpy.concatenate((arr1, arr2, ...), axis=0, out=None)
```

- `(arr1, arr2, ...)`: Sequence of arrays to concatenate.
- `axis`: The axis along which the arrays will be joined. Default is 0.
- `out`: If provided, the output array is placed into this array. If not provided or `None`, a new array is created.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `numpy.concatenate`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Concatenating along axis=0 (rows)
arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])

arr2 = np.array([[7, 8, 9],
                 [10, 11, 12]])

result_axis_0 = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2), axis=0)

print("Original arrays:")
print(arr1)
print("\n", arr2)
print("\nResult after concatenating along axis=0:")
print(result_axis_0)
```

Output:
```
Original arrays:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

 [[ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]

Result after concatenating along axis=0:
[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]
```

In this example, `arr1` and `arr2` are concatenated along `axis=0` (rows).

```python
# Example 2: Concatenating along axis=1 (columns)
arr3 = np.array([[13],
                 [14]])

result_axis_1 = np.concatenate((arr1, arr3), axis=1)

print("Original arrays:")
print(arr1)
print("\n", arr3)
print("\nResult after concatenating along axis=1:")
print(result_axis_1)
```

Output:
```
Original arrays:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

 [[13]
 [14]]

Result after concatenating along axis=1:
[[ 1  2  3 13]
 [ 4  5  6 14]]
```

In this example, `arr1` and `arr3` are concatenated along `axis=1` (columns).

**Important Notes:**

- The shapes of the arrays along the specified axis must be compatible for concatenation.
- If `axis` is not specified, arrays are concatenated along the first axis (axis=0).
- The arrays must have the same number of dimensions, except in the dimension corresponding to `axis`.
- Concatenation along multiple axes is also possible.

It's worth noting that `numpy.concatenate` is a powerful function for combining arrays, and it provides more flexibility than `numpy.append` when dealing with concatenation along different axes.

`numpy.unique` is a function in the NumPy library that returns unique elements of an array. It can also return indices or counts of unique elements. The basic syntax of `numpy.unique` is:

```python
numpy.unique(ar, return_index=False, return_inverse=False, return_counts=False, axis=None)
```

- `ar`: The input array.
- `return_index`: If True, returns the indices of the unique values. Default is False.
- `return_inverse`: If True, returns an array of indices that can be used to reconstruct the original array. Default is False.
- `return_counts`: If True, returns the number of times each unique item appears. Default is False.
- `axis`: The axis or axes along which to operate. Default is None.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `numpy.unique`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example 1: Finding unique elements in a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3])

unique_values_1d = np.unique(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Unique values in 1D array:", unique_values_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3]
Unique values in 1D array: [1 2 3 4 5 6 9]
```

In this example, `numpy.unique` is used to find the unique elements in a 1D array (`arr_1d`).

```python
# Example 2: Finding unique elements and their counts in a 1D array
arr_with_duplicates = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 4, 9, 1, 5])

unique_values, unique_counts = np.unique(arr_with_duplicates, return_counts=True)

print("Original 1D array with duplicates:", arr_with_duplicates)
print("Unique values in 1D array:", unique_values)
print("Counts of unique values:", unique_counts)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array with duplicates: [3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 4 9 1 5]
Unique values in 1D array: [1 2 3 4 5 6 9]
Counts of unique values: [4 1 2 2 3 1 2]
```

In this example, `numpy.unique` is used with `return_counts=True` to find both unique values and their counts in a 1D array with duplicates.

```python
# Example 3: Finding unique rows in a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [1, 2, 3],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

unique_rows = np.unique(arr_2d, axis=0)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nUnique rows in 2D array:")
print(unique_rows)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [1 2 3]
 [7 8 9]]

Unique rows in 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
```

In this example, `numpy.unique` is used with `axis=0` to find unique rows in a 2D array.

**Important Notes:**

- The order of unique elements is not guaranteed unless specified with `return_index` or `return_inverse`.
- When dealing with floating-point numbers, it's recommended to use `numpy.isclose` to handle potential numerical precision issues.
- `numpy.unique` is a versatile function that is often used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis.

It seems there might be a small typo in your question. The correct function is `numpy.expand_dims`, not `numpy.expand-dims`. `numpy.expand_dims` is a function in the NumPy library used to add a new axis at a specified position in the array shape. This can be useful when you want to reshape an array or when working with broadcasting operations.

The basic syntax of `numpy.expand_dims` is:

```python
numpy.expand_dims(a, axis)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `axis`: The position in the expanded axes where the new axis will be inserted.

Here are a couple of examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Expanding a 1D array along a new axis

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Expand the array along a new axis
expanded_arr = np.expand_dims(arr_1d, axis=1)

print("Original 1D array:")
print(arr_1d)
print("\nExpanded array:")
print(expanded_arr)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array:
[1 2 3 4 5]

Expanded array:
[[1]
 [2]
 [3]
 [4]
 [5]]
```

In this example, a new axis is added along axis 1, effectively converting the 1D array into a 2D column vector.

### Example 2: Expanding a 2D array along a new axis

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

# Expand the array along a new axis (axis=2)
expanded_arr_axis_2 = np.expand_dims(arr_2d, axis=2)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nExpanded array along axis=2:")
print(expanded_arr_axis_2)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Expanded array along axis=2:
[[[1]
  [2]
  [3]]

 [[4]
  [5]
  [6]]]
```

In this example, a new axis is added along axis 2, converting the 2D array into a 3D array.

**Note:** The `axis` parameter specifies the position along which the new axis is inserted. If `axis` is not provided, a new axis is added at the end of the shape. It's essential to consider the impact on array dimensions and broadcasting when using `numpy.expand_dims`.

`numpy.where` is a powerful function in NumPy that provides a flexible way to perform conditional operations and extract elements from arrays based on a specified condition. It returns the indices where the condition is true. The basic syntax of `numpy.where` is:

```python
numpy.where(condition, [x, y])
```

- `condition`: A boolean array or a condition that evaluates to a boolean array.
- `x`, `y`: Values to be returned where `condition` is True or False, respectively. If not specified, returns indices where `condition` is True.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Use numpy.where to get indices where the condition is true
indices = np.where(arr > 2)

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Indices where arr > 2:", indices)
print("Values where arr > 2:", arr[indices])
```

Output:
```
Original array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Indices where arr > 2: (array([2, 3, 4]),)
Values where arr > 2: [3 4 5]
```

In this example, `numpy.where` is used to find the indices where the values in the array are greater than 2.

### Example 2: Using x and y parameters

```python
# Create a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Use numpy.where with x and y parameters
result = np.where(arr > 2, 'A', 'B')

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Result based on condition (arr > 2):", result)
```

Output:
```
Original array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Result based on condition (arr > 2): ['B' 'B' 'A' 'A' 'A']
```

In this example, `numpy.where` is used to assign values 'A' where the condition is True (arr > 2) and 'B' where the condition is False.

### Example 3: Combining conditions

```python
# Create a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Use numpy.where with multiple conditions
result = np.where((arr > 2) & (arr < 5), 'A', 'B')

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Result based on conditions (2 < arr < 5):", result)
```

Output:
```
Original array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Result based on conditions (2 < arr < 5): ['B' 'B' 'A' 'A' 'B']
```

In this example, `numpy.where` is used with multiple conditions (logical AND) to assign values based on a more complex condition.

`numpy.where` is a versatile function that can be used for various scenarios where conditional operations are required, making it a valuable tool for array manipulation and data processing.

`numpy.argmax` is a NumPy function that returns the indices of the maximum values along a specified axis. If the axis is not specified, it returns the indices of the flattened array. The basic syntax of `numpy.argmax` is:

```python
numpy.argmax(a, axis=None, out=None)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `axis`: The axis along which the indices of the maximum values are computed. Default is None.
- `out`: If provided, the result is placed into this array. If not provided or `None`, a new array is created.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Finding the index of the maximum value in a 1D array

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3])

# Find the index of the maximum value in the 1D array
max_index = np.argmax(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Index of the maximum value:", max_index)
print("Maximum value:", arr_1d[max_index])
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3]
Index of the maximum value: 5
Maximum value: 9
```

In this example, `numpy.argmax` is used to find the index of the maximum value in a 1D array.

### Example 2: Finding the index of the maximum value along a specific axis in a 2D array

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Find the indices of the maximum values along axis=1 (rows)
max_indices_axis_1 = np.argmax(arr_2d, axis=1)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nIndices of maximum values along axis=1 (rows):", max_indices_axis_1)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

Indices of maximum values along axis=1 (rows): [2 2 2]
```

In this example, `numpy.argmax` is used with `axis=1` to find the indices of the maximum values along each row in a 2D array.

### Example 3: Using `out` parameter

```python
# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3])

# Provide an existing array for the result using the out parameter
result = np.zeros_like(arr_1d)
max_index_out = np.argmax(arr_1d, out=result)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Index of the maximum value (using out):", max_index_out)
print("Result array (using out):", result)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3]
Index of the maximum value (using out): 5
Result array (using out): [0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0]
```

In this example, an existing array `result` is provided using the `out` parameter. The result is filled with zeros and then updated with the index of the maximum value.

`numpy.argmax` is useful for finding the indices of maximum values along a specified axis, which can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where you need to locate peak values in your data.

`numpy.cumsum` is a NumPy function that computes the cumulative sum of elements along a specified axis. The basic syntax of `numpy.cumsum` is:

```python
numpy.cumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `axis`: The axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. Default is None (flattens the input array).
- `dtype`: The data type of the output array. If not specified, the data type of `a` is used.
- `out`: If provided, the result is placed into this array. If not provided or `None`, a new array is created.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Cumulative sum of a 1D array

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Compute the cumulative sum of the 1D array
cumulative_sum_1d = np.cumsum(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Cumulative sum of 1D array:", cumulative_sum_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Cumulative sum of 1D array: [ 1  3  6 10 15]
```

In this example, `numpy.cumsum` is used to compute the cumulative sum of a 1D array.

### Example 2: Cumulative sum along a specific axis in a 2D array

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

# Compute the cumulative sum along axis=1 (columns)
cumulative_sum_axis_1 = np.cumsum(arr_2d, axis=1)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nCumulative sum along axis=1 (columns):")
print(cumulative_sum_axis_1)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Cumulative sum along axis=1 (columns):
[[ 1  3  6]
 [ 4  9 15]]
```

In this example, `numpy.cumsum` is used with `axis=1` to compute the cumulative sum along each column in a 2D array.

### Example 3: Using `dtype` parameter

```python
# Create a 1D array with floating-point numbers
arr_float = np.array([1.5, 2.3, 3.1, 4.7, 5.2])

# Compute the cumulative sum with a specific dtype (int)
cumulative_sum_int = np.cumsum(arr_float, dtype=int)

print("Original 1D array with floats:", arr_float)
print("Cumulative sum with dtype=int:")
print(cumulative_sum_int)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array with floats: [1.5 2.3 3.1 4.7 5.2]
Cumulative sum with dtype=int:
[ 1  3  6 10 15]
```

In this example, `numpy.cumsum` is used with the `dtype` parameter to compute the cumulative sum with integer values.

`numpy.cumsum` is helpful for calculating running totals and can be used to track accumulated values over time, making it valuable in various applications, including time-series analysis and signal processing.

`numpy.cumprod` is a NumPy function that computes the cumulative product of elements along a specified axis. The basic syntax of `numpy.cumprod` is:

```python
numpy.cumprod(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `axis`: The axis along which the cumulative product is computed. Default is None (flattens the input array).
- `dtype`: The data type of the output array. If not specified, the data type of `a` is used.
- `out`: If provided, the result is placed into this array. If not provided or `None`, a new array is created.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Cumulative product of a 1D array

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Compute the cumulative product of the 1D array
cumulative_prod_1d = np.cumprod(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Cumulative product of 1D array:", cumulative_prod_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Cumulative product of 1D array: [  1   2   6  24 120]
```

In this example, `numpy.cumprod` is used to compute the cumulative product of a 1D array.

### Example 2: Cumulative product along a specific axis in a 2D array

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

# Compute the cumulative product along axis=0 (rows)
cumulative_prod_axis_0 = np.cumprod(arr_2d, axis=0)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nCumulative product along axis=0 (rows):")
print(cumulative_prod_axis_0)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Cumulative product along axis=0 (rows):
[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4 10 18]]
```

In this example, `numpy.cumprod` is used with `axis=0` to compute the cumulative product along each row in a 2D array.

### Example 3: Using `dtype` parameter

```python
# Create a 1D array with floating-point numbers
arr_float = np.array([1.5, 2.3, 3.1, 4.7, 5.2])

# Compute the cumulative product with a specific dtype (int)
cumulative_prod_int = np.cumprod(arr_float, dtype=int)

print("Original 1D array with floats:", arr_float)
print("Cumulative product with dtype=int:")
print(cumulative_prod_int)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array with floats: [1.5 2.3 3.1 4.7 5.2]
Cumulative product with dtype=int:
[  1   3   9  42 218]
```

In this example, `numpy.cumprod` is used with the `dtype` parameter to compute the cumulative product with integer values.

`numpy.cumprod` is useful for calculating running products and can be used to track accumulated values over time, similar to `numpy.cumsum`. It is often used in finance, statistics, and other fields where cumulative products are relevant.

`numpy.percentile` is a NumPy function that computes the q-th percentile of the data along a specified axis. The percentile is a measure indicating the relative standing of a particular value in a dataset. The basic syntax of `numpy.percentile` is:

```python
numpy.percentile(a, q, axis=None, out=None, interpolation='linear', keepdims=False)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `q`: The percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, in the range [0, 100].
- `axis`: The axis along which the percentiles are computed. Default is None (flattens the input array).
- `out`: If provided, the result is placed into this array. If not provided or `None`, a new array is created.
- `interpolation`: Specifies the method used to interpolate between data points when the requested percentile lies between two data points. Options include 'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', and 'nearest'.
- `keepdims`: If True, the reduced dimensions are retained with size 1.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Computing a single percentile

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Compute the 25th percentile (first quartile) of the 1D array
percentile_25 = np.percentile(arr_1d, 25)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("25th percentile:", percentile_25)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10]
25th percentile: 3.25
```

In this example, `numpy.percentile` is used to compute the 25th percentile of a 1D array.

### Example 2: Computing multiple percentiles

```python
# Compute the 10th, 50th (median), and 90th percentiles of the 1D array
percentiles = np.percentile(arr_1d, [10, 50, 90])

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("10th, 50th (median), and 90th percentiles:", percentiles)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10]
10th, 50th (median), and 90th percentiles: [ 2.   5.5  9.1]
```

In this example, `numpy.percentile` is used to compute multiple percentiles of a 1D array.

### Example 3: Computing percentiles along a specific axis in a 2D array

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Compute the 25th percentile along axis=0 (columns) of the 2D array
percentile_25_axis_0 = np.percentile(arr_2d, 25, axis=0)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\n25th percentile along axis=0 (columns):", percentile_25_axis_0)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

25th percentile along axis=0 (columns): [2.5 4.5 6.5]
```

In this example, `numpy.percentile` is used with `axis=0` to compute the 25th percentile along each column in a 2D array.

`numpy.percentile` is a useful function for summarizing the distribution of data and understanding its spread. It is commonly used in statistics and data analysis to describe the position of a particular value within a dataset.

`numpy.histogram` is a function in NumPy used for computing the histogram of a set of data. It bins the data into discrete intervals (bins) and returns the counts of data points in each bin. The basic syntax of `numpy.histogram` is:

```python
numpy.histogram(a, bins=10, range=None, density=False, weights=None, cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid', orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False, color=None, label=None, stacked=False, data=None)
```

- `a`: The input data for which the histogram is computed.
- `bins`: Either an integer specifying the number of bins, or an array specifying the bin edges.
- `range`: The lower and upper range of the bins. If not specified, it is inferred from the input data.
- `density`: If True, the histogram represents a probability density function, i.e., the area under the histogram will sum to 1.
- `weights`: An array of weights, each value in the input data is weighted by its corresponding weight.
- `cumulative`: If True, a cumulative histogram is computed.
- Many other parameters that control the appearance of the histogram.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Basic histogram with default settings

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate random data
data = np.random.randn(1000)

# Compute histogram
hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(data, bins=10)

# Plot histogram
plt.hist(data, bins=10, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Histogram of Random Data')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

In this example, a histogram is computed and plotted for randomly generated data.

### Example 2: Customizing histogram appearance

```python
# Generate random data
data = np.random.randn(1000)

# Compute histogram with custom settings
hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(data, bins=20, range=(-3, 3), density=True, color='skyblue', alpha=0.75)

# Plot histogram with custom appearance
plt.hist(data, bins=20, range=(-3, 3), density=True, color='skyblue', alpha=0.75, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Customized Histogram of Random Data')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.show()
```

In this example, a histogram is computed with custom settings, including a different number of bins, a specified range, density normalization, color, and transparency.

### Example 3: Cumulative histogram

```python
# Generate random data
data = np.random.randn(1000)

# Compute cumulative histogram
hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(data, bins=20, density=True, cumulative=True)

# Plot cumulative histogram
plt.hist(data, bins=20, density=True, cumulative=True, histtype='step', color='orange', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Cumulative Histogram of Random Data')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Density')
plt.show()
```

In this example, a cumulative histogram is computed and plotted for randomly generated data.

`numpy.histogram` is a versatile tool for visualizing the distribution of data, exploring patterns, and identifying trends. It is commonly used in data analysis and statistics to gain insights into the underlying structure of datasets.

`numpy.corrcoef` is a NumPy function that computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two or more arrays. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables. The basic syntax of `numpy.corrcoef` is:

```python
numpy.corrcoef(x, y=None, rowvar=True, bias=<no value>, ddof=<no value>)
```

- `x`: The input array or sequence of arrays. Each column represents a variable, and each row is an observation.
- `y`: If provided, a second array. If not provided, the correlation coefficient within `x` is computed.
- `rowvar`: If True (default), each row represents a variable, and each column is an observation. If False, each column represents a variable, and each row is an observation.
- `bias`: Not used. It is included for backward compatibility.
- `ddof`: Delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in calculations is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. The default is 1.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Computing correlation coefficient between two arrays

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate random data
x = np.random.randn(100)
y = 2 * x + 0.5 * np.random.randn(100)  # y is approximately linearly dependent on x

# Compute correlation coefficient between x and y
correlation_coefficient = np.corrcoef(x, y)[0, 1]

print("Correlation coefficient between x and y:", correlation_coefficient)
```

In this example, `numpy.corrcoef` is used to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between two arrays (`x` and `y`). Since `y` is approximately linearly dependent on `x`, the correlation coefficient should be close to 1.

### Example 2: Computing correlation matrix for a set of variables

```python
# Generate a 2D array with multiple variables
data = np.random.randn(100, 3)

# Compute correlation matrix for the variables
correlation_matrix = np.corrcoef(data, rowvar=False)

print("Original data shape:", data.shape)
print("Correlation matrix shape:", correlation_matrix.shape)
print("Correlation matrix:")
print(correlation_matrix)
```

In this example, `numpy.corrcoef` is used to compute the correlation matrix for a set of variables stored in a 2D array (`data`). Each column represents a variable, and each row is an observation.

### Example 3: Using rowvar=False

```python
# Generate a 2D array with multiple variables
data = np.random.randn(3, 100)

# Compute correlation matrix with rowvar=False
correlation_matrix_rowvar_false = np.corrcoef(data, rowvar=False)

print("Original data shape:", data.shape)
print("Correlation matrix shape (rowvar=False):", correlation_matrix_rowvar_false.shape)
print("Correlation matrix (rowvar=False):")
print(correlation_matrix_rowvar_false)
```

In this example, `numpy.corrcoef` is used with `rowvar=False` to compute the correlation matrix when each column represents a variable, and each row is an observation.

The output of `numpy.corrcoef` is a correlation matrix where the element at position `[i, j]` represents the correlation between the i-th and j-th variables. The diagonal elements (i.e., `[i, i]`) are always 1 since they represent the correlation of a variable with itself.

`numpy.corrcoef` is a valuable tool for analyzing relationships between variables in datasets, helping to identify patterns and dependencies. It is commonly used in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning applications.

`numpy.isin` is a NumPy function that tests element-wise whether elements of one array are present in another array. The basic syntax of `numpy.isin` is:

```python
numpy.isin(element, test_elements, assume_unique=False, invert=False)
```

- `element`: The array of elements to test for membership.
- `test_elements`: The array of test elements. Membership is checked against these elements.
- `assume_unique`: If True, the input arrays are assumed to be unique, which can speed up the calculation. Default is False.
- `invert`: If True, the boolean array returned is inverted, i.e., True for elements not in the `test_elements`. Default is False.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Testing membership for a single element

```python
import numpy as np

# Test if 3 is present in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = np.isin(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print("Is 3 present in the array?:", result)
```

Output:
```
Is 3 present in the array?: True
```

In this example, `numpy.isin` is used to check if the element 3 is present in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Example 2: Testing membership for multiple elements

```python
# Test if elements [2, 6, 8] are present in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result_multiple = np.isin([2, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print("Are elements [2, 6, 8] present in the array?:", result_multiple)
```

Output:
```
Are elements [2, 6, 8] present in the array?: [ True False  True]
```

In this example, `numpy.isin` is used to check if the elements [2, 6, 8] are present in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

### Example 3: Using invert parameter

```python
# Test if elements [2, 6, 8] are NOT present in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result_invert = np.isin([2, 6, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], invert=True)

print("Are elements [2, 6, 8] NOT present in the array?:", result_invert)
```

Output:
```
Are elements [2, 6, 8] NOT present in the array?: [False  True False]
```

In this example, the `invert` parameter is set to True, so `numpy.isin` checks if the elements [2, 6, 8] are not present in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

`numpy.isin` is useful for checking membership of elements in an array and can be applied to various scenarios, such as filtering or masking data based on specific conditions.

`numpy.flip` is a NumPy function that reverses the order of elements along a specified axis. The basic syntax of `numpy.flip` is:

```python
numpy.flip(m, axis=None)
```

- `m`: The input array or sequence of arrays.
- `axis`: The axis or axes along which the elements are reversed. By default, all axes are reversed.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Flipping a 1D array

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Flip the 1D array
flipped_arr_1d = np.flip(arr_1d)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Flipped 1D array:", flipped_arr_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Flipped 1D array: [5 4 3 2 1]
```

In this example, `numpy.flip` is used to reverse the order of elements in a 1D array.

### Example 2: Flipping a 2D array along a specific axis

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Flip the 2D array along axis=0 (rows)
flipped_arr_2d_axis_0 = np.flip(arr_2d, axis=0)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nFlipped 2D array along axis=0 (rows):")
print(flipped_arr_2d_axis_0)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

Flipped 2D array along axis=0 (rows):
[[7 8 9]
 [4 5 6]
 [1 2 3]]
```

In this example, `numpy.flip` is used with `axis=0` to reverse the order of rows in a 2D array.

### Example 3: Flipping a 3D array along multiple axes

```python
# Create a 3D array
arr_3d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]],
                   [[7, 8, 9],
                    [10, 11, 12]]])

# Flip the 3D array along axes (0, 1, 2)
flipped_arr_3d = np.flip(arr_3d, axis=(0, 1, 2))

print("Original 3D array:")
print(arr_3d)
print("\nFlipped 3D array along axes (0, 1, 2):")
print(flipped_arr_3d)
```

Output:
```
Original 3D array:
[[[ 1  2  3]
  [ 4  5  6]]

 [[ 7  8  9]
  [10 11 12]]]

Flipped 3D array along axes (0, 1, 2):
[[[12 11 10]
  [ 9  8  7]]

 [[ 6  5  4]
  [ 3  2  1]]]
```

In this example, `numpy.flip` is used with `axis=(0, 1, 2)` to reverse the order along all axes in a 3D array.

`numpy.flip` is a versatile function that allows you to reverse the order of elements along one or more axes in an array. It is useful for various array manipulation tasks.

### `numpy.put`

`numpy.put` is a NumPy function that replaces specified elements of an array with given values. The basic syntax of `numpy.put` is:

```python
numpy.put(a, ind, v, mode='raise')
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `ind`: The indices at which to place values. This can be an array or a list of indices.
- `v`: The values to place at the specified indices. This can be a scalar or an array.
- `mode`: Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave. Options are 'raise', 'wrap', and 'clip'.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

#### Example 1: Replace elements in a 1D array at specified indices

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Replace elements at indices 1 and 3 with new values
indices = [1, 3]
values = [10, 20]

np.put(arr_1d, indices, values)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [ 1 10  3 20  5]
```

In this example, `numpy.put` is used to replace elements at specified indices in a 1D array.

#### Example 2: Replace elements in a 2D array at specified indices

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Replace elements at indices (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 0) with new values
indices_2d = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
values_2d = [10, 20, 30]

np.put(arr_2d, indices_2d, values_2d)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[ 1 10  3]
 [ 4  5 20]
 [30  8  9]]
```

In this example, `numpy.put` is used to replace elements at specified indices in a 2D array.

### `numpy.delete`

`numpy.delete` is a NumPy function that returns a new array with sub-arrays along an axis deleted. The basic syntax of `numpy.delete` is:

```python
numpy.delete(arr, obj, axis=None)
```

- `arr`: The input array.
- `obj`: The indices or slice to delete.
- `axis`: The axis along which to delete the sub-arrays. If not specified, the array is flattened.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

#### Example 1: Delete elements from a 1D array at specified indices

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Delete elements at indices 1 and 3
indices_to_delete = [1, 3]

arr_1d_deleted = np.delete(arr_1d, indices_to_delete)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("1D array after deletion:", arr_1d_deleted)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [1 2 3 4 5]
1D array after deletion: [1 3 5]
```

In this example, `numpy.delete` is used to delete elements at specified indices in a 1D array.

#### Example 2: Delete rows from a 2D array along a specific axis

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])

# Delete the second row along axis=0 (rows)
row_to_delete = 1

arr_2d_deleted_rows = np.delete(arr_2d, row_to_delete, axis=0)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("2D array after deleting the second row:")
print(arr_2d_deleted_rows)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

2D array after deleting the second row:
[[1 2 3]
 [7 8 9]]
```

In this example, `numpy.delete` is used to delete a specific row along axis=0 in a 2D array.

`numpy.put` and `numpy.delete` are powerful tools for modifying arrays by either replacing elements at specified indices or deleting elements along a specific axis. They are commonly used in data manipulation and array processing tasks.

NumPy provides several set-related functions that operate on arrays to perform operations similar to mathematical sets. Here are some of the key set functions in NumPy explained with examples:

### `numpy.unique`

`numpy.unique` returns the sorted unique elements of an array.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with duplicate elements
arr = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5])

# Get unique elements
unique_elements = np.unique(arr)

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Unique elements:", unique_elements)
```

Output:
```
Original array: [1 2 2 3 4 4 5]
Unique elements: [1 2 3 4 5]
```

### `numpy.in1d`

`numpy.in1d` tests whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array.

```python
# Check which elements of another array are present in the original array
test_elements = np.array([2, 5, 8])
result = np.in1d(test_elements, arr)

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Test elements:", test_elements)
print("Elements present in both arrays:", result)
```

Output:
```
Original array: [1 2 2 3 4 4 5]
Test elements: [2 5 8]
Elements present in both arrays: [ True  True False]
```

### `numpy.setdiff1d`

`numpy.setdiff1d` finds the set difference of two arrays.

```python
# Find elements in the first array that are not present in the second array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array([3, 5, 7])

diff_elements = np.setdiff1d(arr1, arr2)

print("Array 1:", arr1)
print("Array 2:", arr2)
print("Set difference:", diff_elements)
```

Output:
```
Array 1: [1 2 3 4 5]
Array 2: [3 5 7]
Set difference: [1 2 4]
```

### `numpy.intersect1d`

`numpy.intersect1d` finds the intersection of two arrays.

```python
# Find elements that are common to both arrays
arr3 = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])
common_elements = np.intersect1d(arr1, arr3)

print("Array 1:", arr1)
print("Array 3:", arr3)
print("Common elements:", common_elements)
```

Output:
```
Array 1: [1 2 3 4 5]
Array 3: [2 4 6 8]
Common elements: [2 4]
```

### `numpy.union1d`

`numpy.union1d` finds the union of two arrays.

```python
# Find elements that are in either of the two arrays
arr4 = np.array([5, 7, 9])
union_elements = np.union1d(arr1, arr4)

print("Array 1:", arr1)
print("Array 4:", arr4)
print("Union of elements:", union_elements)
```

Output:
```
Array 1: [1 2 3 4 5]
Array 4: [5 7 9]
Union of elements: [1 2 3 4 5 7 9]
```

These set functions in NumPy are useful for various data manipulation tasks, especially when dealing with arrays and sets of elements. They provide a convenient way to perform set operations efficiently on arrays.

### `numpy.in1d`

`numpy.in1d` is a function that tests whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in another array. It returns a boolean array of the same shape as the input indicating whether each element is found in the specified second array.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array and a test array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5])
test_elements = np.array([2, 5, 8])

# Check which elements of the test array are present in the original array
result = np.in1d(test_elements, arr)

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Test elements:", test_elements)
print("Elements present in both arrays:", result)
```

Output:
```
Original array: [1 2 2 3 4 4 5]
Test elements: [2 5 8]
Elements present in both arrays: [ True  True False]
```

In this example, `numpy.in1d` is used to check which elements of the `test_elements` array are present in the `arr` array.

### `numpy.setxor1d`

`numpy.setxor1d` returns the exclusive-or of two arrays, i.e., elements that are in either of the arrays, but not in both. It is similar to the set symmetric difference operation.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array([3, 5, 7])

# Find the set exclusive-or of the two arrays
xor_elements = np.setxor1d(arr1, arr2)

print("Array 1:", arr1)
print("Array 2:", arr2)
print("Set exclusive-or of elements:", xor_elements)
```

Output:
```
Array 1: [1 2 3 4 5]
Array 2: [3 5 7]
Set exclusive-or of elements: [1 2 4 7]
```

In this example, `numpy.setxor1d` is used to find the set exclusive-or of elements between `arr1` and `arr2`.

Both `numpy.in1d` and `numpy.setxor1d` are useful for performing set-related operations on arrays, providing flexibility in comparing and manipulating data.

`numpy.clip` is a NumPy function that clips (limits) the values in an array between a specified minimum and maximum. The basic syntax of `numpy.clip` is:

```python
numpy.clip(a, a_min, a_max, out=None)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `a_min`: The minimum value. Values less than `a_min` are set to `a_min`.
- `a_max`: The maximum value. Values greater than `a_max` are set to `a_max`.
- `out`: If provided, the result is placed into this array. If not provided or `None`, a new array is created.

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage:

### Example 1: Clipping values in a 1D array

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 5, 10, -3, 8])

# Clip values in the array to be between 2 and 8
clipped_arr_1d = np.clip(arr_1d, a_min=2, a_max=8)

print("Original 1D array:", arr_1d)
print("Clipped 1D array:", clipped_arr_1d)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array: [ 1  5 10 -3  8]
Clipped 1D array: [2 5 8 2 8]
```

In this example, `numpy.clip` is used to clip values in a 1D array to be between 2 and 8.

### Example 2: Clipping values in a 2D array

```python
# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [-1, 8, 10]])

# Clip values in the array to be between 3 and 7
clipped_arr_2d = np.clip(arr_2d, a_min=3, a_max=7)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nClipped 2D array:")
print(clipped_arr_2d)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[ 1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6]
 [-1  8 10]]

Clipped 2D array:
[[3 3 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [3 7 7]]
```

In this example, `numpy.clip` is used to clip values in a 2D array to be between 3 and 7.

### Example 3: Using an output array

```python
# Create an array and an output array
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
output_arr = np.zeros_like(arr)

# Clip values in the array to be between 20 and 40 and store the result in the output array
np.clip(arr, a_min=20, a_max=40, out=output_arr)

print("Original array:", arr)
print("Output array after clipping:", output_arr)
```

Output:
```
Original array: [10 20 30 40 50]
Output array after clipping: [20 20 30 40 40]
```

In this example, `numpy.clip` is used with an output array to store the result of clipping values between 20 and 40.

`numpy.clip` is useful for situations where you want to limit the range of values in an array, ensuring that they do not exceed specified minimum and maximum values. It is commonly used in data preprocessing and normalization tasks.

It seems like there's a mix of functions in your question. Let me clarify the information for each function:

### `numpy.swapaxes`

`numpy.swapaxes` is a function that interchanges two axes of an array. The basic syntax is:

```python
numpy.swapaxes(a, axis1, axis2)
```

- `a`: The input array.
- `axis1, axis2`: The axes to be swapped.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

# Swap the axes (transpose the array)
swapped_arr = np.swapaxes(arr_2d, 0, 1)

print("Original 2D array:")
print(arr_2d)
print("\nSwapped 2D array:")
print(swapped_arr)
```

Output:
```
Original 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

Swapped 2D array:
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
```

### `numpy.uniform`

There is no `numpy.uniform` function in NumPy. If you meant `numpy.random.uniform`, it generates random numbers from a uniform distribution.

### `numpy.count_nonzero`

`numpy.count_nonzero` counts the number of non-zero elements in an array. The basic syntax is:

```python
numpy.count_nonzero(a)
```

- `a`: The input array.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array with some zero and non-zero elements
arr = np.array([[1, 0, 3],
                [0, 5, 0]])

# Count the number of non-zero elements
nonzero_count = np.count_nonzero(arr)

print("Original array:")
print(arr)
print("\nNumber of non-zero elements:", nonzero_count)
```

Output:
```
Original array:
[[1 0 3]
 [0 5 0]]

Number of non-zero elements: 3
```

### `numpy.tile`

`numpy.tile` constructs an array by repeating an input array a certain number of times along specified axes. The basic syntax is:

```python
numpy.tile(A, reps)
```

- `A`: The input array.
- `reps`: The number of repetitions along each axis.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Tile the array along a new axis
tiled_arr = np.tile(arr_1d, (3, 1))

print("Original 1D array:")
print(arr_1d)
print("\nTiled 2D array:")
print(tiled_arr)
```

Output:
```
Original 1D array:
[1 2 3]

Tiled 2D array:
[[1 2 3]
 [1 2 3]
 [1 2 3]]
```

### `numpy.title`

There is no `numpy.title` function in NumPy. If you meant `numpy.tile`, please see the explanation above.

If you have any specific questions about a particular function or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

`np.allclose` and `np.array_equal` are both functions in NumPy, but they serve different purposes.

### `np.allclose`

`np.allclose` is used to compare whether two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance. The basic syntax is:

```python
numpy.allclose(a, b, rtol=1e-05, atol=1e-08, equal_nan=False)
```

- `a`, `b`: The arrays to be compared.
- `rtol`: The relative tolerance parameter (default is 1e-05).
- `atol`: The absolute tolerance parameter (default is 1e-08).
- `equal_nan`: If True, NaNs will compare equal (default is False).

This function returns True if all elements of `a` and `b` are within the specified tolerance of each other.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two arrays
a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compare the arrays
result = np.allclose(a, b)

print("Arrays a and b are close:", result)
```

Output:
```
Arrays a and b are close: True
```

### `np.array_equal`

`np.array_equal` is used to check whether two arrays are equal in shape and elements. The basic syntax is:

```python
numpy.array_equal(a1, a2)
```

- `a1`, `a2`: The arrays to be compared.

This function returns True if the arrays have the same shape and elements, False otherwise.

#### Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two arrays
a1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
a2 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Compare the arrays
result = np.array_equal(a1, a2)

print("Arrays a1 and a2 are equal:", result)
```

Output:
```
Arrays a1 and a2 are equal: True
```

### Difference

The main difference between `np.allclose` and `np.array_equal` is that `np.allclose` checks whether the arrays are element-wise close within a tolerance, whereas `np.array_equal` checks for exact equality in terms of shape and elements.

It's important to choose the appropriate function depending on the specific comparison requirements in your code. If you need to handle numerical imprecision or floating-point comparisons, `np.allclose` is often more suitable. If you need exact equality, `np.array_equal` is the better choice.
